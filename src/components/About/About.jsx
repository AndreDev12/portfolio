        <p>Hello! My name is Héctor André, I am a university student who likes to improve myself professionally, I enjoy creating web applications and I love learning the English language. My interest in web development started when I was building a responsive design application on top of a portfolio made in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the SwiperJS library. Then I got really excited learning React, practicing it with Frontend Mentor challenges and reviewing other programmers' code on GitHub.</p>
